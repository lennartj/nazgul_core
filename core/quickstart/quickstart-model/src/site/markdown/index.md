# About the Nazgul Core: quickstart model

The Nazgul Core quickstart models defines the model holding the data required to quickly create a project 
structure or software component (i.e. collaborating set of Maven projects). Typically, 
these entities are particularly useful within quickstart tools such as [JBoss Forge](http://forge.jboss.org/)
or [Maven Archetypes](http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html). 

Normally, the Quickstart API contains the services and methods required to validate/detect compliant
project structures as well as creating new ones.
