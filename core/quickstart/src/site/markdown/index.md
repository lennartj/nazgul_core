# About the Nazgul Core: Quickstart

We programmers tend to want to get started quickly with new projects or concepts.
The quickstart components assist in doing just that; tools such as Maven Archetype
Plugin or JBoss Forge can use the Quickstart analyzer and generator components to
quickly validate and generate software projects complying with a set of patterns.
Each component has implementations for analyzing and generating Nazgul Software
Component project skeletons, but can easily be used for other implementations as well.

Please refer to the API projects of the respective components for detailed usage information.
