# About the Nazgul Core: Resource Software Component

The Resource NSC (Nazgul Software Component) provides a simple means to read and interpret
packaged (and optionally localized) resources. While some resource manipulations are typical
of running Java SE applications the Resource NSC also holds utilities to read build-time
version information in runtime, which is frequently needed in large Java EE systems.
