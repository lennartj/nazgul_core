# Nazgul Core: Test reactor

Frequently when building large projects, it can be helpful to create
utility classes which reduce the complexity of unit tests. We all want
to be able to focus on the actual test data instead of setting up 
boilerplate scaffolding code.

The Nazgul Core: Test reactor holds projects containing utility classes
intended for use as test-scope dependencies, typically abstract 
superclasses or utilities simplifying automated testing.
