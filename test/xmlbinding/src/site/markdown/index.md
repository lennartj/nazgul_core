# About the Nazgul Core: XmlBinding Test

Validating that two XML structures are identical (or differ only in certain areas) is frequently
a non-trivial task; direct string comparisons are insufficient as they frequently stumble on problems
with whitespace, attribute order, comments etc. Some frameworks such as XmlUnit exist to remedy the
situation, but they tend to be complex or cumbersome to use. The XmlBinding Test project contains
classes to simplify unit testing XML structures.

Moreover, the potential pain of converting XML-based structures containing dates or timezones
is mitigated using the StandardTimeZoneRule (jUnit rule), which is conveniently applied within the
AbstractStandardizedTimezoneTest superclass. Using this class as superclass for tests implies that
all tests will be run in a well-defined DateTimeZone (joda-time, not java.util-based).

## Typical use of the XmlBinding Test facilities

Typically, unmarshalling Java Objects from XML is used to resurrect/re-create the memory state
of Java Objects previously written to XML form. If the XML data has been generated by the
XmlBinding JAXB SPI, it can be resurrected in a simple manner:

<pre class="brush: java" title="Example use of standard DateTimeZone in a test."><![CDATA[
// Create the xml binder
final JaxbXmlBinder binder = new JaxbXmlBinder();

// Unmarshal XML to resurrect the objects previously written
final Reader input = ... read XML data from a stream connected to a file/socket/whatever ...
final List<Object> result = unitUnderTest.unmarshal(input);

// The result list now contains the objects previously marshalled, as per above.
]]></pre>
